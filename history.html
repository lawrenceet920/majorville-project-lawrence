            <h2>Fun Facts!</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When John Major settled, he began buying land in Platte and Lake townships as investments and, in late 1854, purchased the 122 acres from Orange and Sally Risdon of Saline, MI. Major cleared 20 acres and built a log cabin for his family to live in. Then he planted some black locust trees and an apple orchard around the cabin.</li>
                <li>O’Leary didn’t have any experience in the lumber business, so he began looking for someone who could manage his enterprise, He found Charles T. Wright.</li>
                <li>The sawmill was a 2-story wood building typical of sawmills of that time. The creek was dammed to create a mill pond right in front of the sawmill. The logs were floated down the creek to the mill pond and then lifted from the pond up an inclined ramp with a chain loop powered by the steam engine through a belt and pulley system that was also used to run the saw blade. The sawing was done on the second floor.</li>

            <h2>History of Our Town</h2>
            <p>
                Following the U. S. Civil War, the veterans returned home, and John Major settled with his wife Julia and daughter Anna in Northern Michigan. Dr. Arthur O’Leary, a distinctive looking man of Irish descent. He began buying up large tracts of forest and made plans to build a sawmill. Daniel Thomas and William Woodward built a dock on John Major’s property on Lake Michigan, just north of Pine Creek.
                The sawmill was built on the south side of Pine Creek not far from Lake Michigan.
                The mill was connected to the dock with an elevated roadway
                A boarding house was built south of the mill, and horse barns were built north of the creek. The town of Majorville was established. Majorville is located on Lake Michigan where Pine Creek empties into Lake Michigan just south of Esky Road.
